## 📖 Overview

**Youth Competency Intelligence Graph** is an advanced career development platform designed to bridge the gap between education and employability.By leveraging a directed acyclic graph (DAG) structure for skill dependencies, the application provides users with personalized learning paths, role readiness assessments, and AI-driven resource recommendations.

This project goes beyond simple to-do lists by intelligently mapping skills to target roles, visualizing progress through interactive graphs, and assessing cognitive aptitude via an integrated psychometric test suite.

## ✨ Key Features

- **🧠 Intelligent Skill Mapping:** Visualizes skill dependencies using a directed graph (DAG) to generate topologically sorted learning paths.
- **🎯 Role Readiness Tracker:** Real-time percentage tracking of readiness for target roles based on acquired skills.
- **📊 Interactive Dashboard:** robust analytics dashboard displaying aptitude scores, skill progress, and career insights.
- **🔐 Secure Authentication:** Full authentication system with JWT, bcrypt hashing, and Email OTP verification.
- **🧩 Psychometric Assessment:** Integrated cognitive testing module (Numerical, Verbal, Abstract, etc.) with immediate graphical feedback.
- **🤖 Smart Recommendations:** Algorithmic suggestions for learning resources based on individual skill gaps.
- **⚡ Modern State Management:** Scalable frontend architecture using **Redux Toolkit** for global state management.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up the project locally.

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+ recommended)
- MongoDB (Local or Atlas URI)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the Repository**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/geeky-rish/Youth-Competency-Graph.git
    cd Youth-Competency-Graph
    ```

2.  **Setup Backend**
    ```bash
    cd server
    npm install
    ```
    - Create a `.env` file in the `server` directory:
      ```env
      PORT=3000
      MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
      JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
      EMAIL_USER=your_email_address
      EMAIL_PASS=your_email_app_password
      ```
    - Seed the database (optional but recommended):
      ```bash
      node seed.js
      ```
    - Start the server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

3.  **Setup Frontend**
    ```bash
    cd ../client
    npm install
    ```
    - Start the development server:
      ```bash
      npm run dev
      ```

4.  **Access the Application**
    - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`.
